<h1>AlbumEasy - Getting Started</h1>
Albums are defined by a set of commands in an album definition file.
This is a regular text file which is created by means of a
text editor or word-processor. AlbumEasy processes these commands to generate an
Album in PDF format for later viewing and printing.<br /><br />

Although it is possible to use almost any text editor such as the very basic Windows Notepad,
it will be far more productive to use one of the many excellent text editors that are
available free on the Web. A few examples are <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a> and
<a href="http://www.geany.org/">Geany</a> which are both cross platform,
or the Windows only <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/">Programmer's Notepad</a>.
Alternatively a word-processor may be used in which case it is important to enure that the
file is saved in text only format.
<br /><br />

A PDF viewer such as the ubiquitous Adobe Acrobat is also necessary for viewing and printing the
generated Albums. In most cases the user is likely to have this already installed on their system,
If not it may be downloaded free of charge from
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/">http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/</a><br />
<br />
<span class="important">NOTE:</span> When printing from Acrobat, please ensure that the <i>"Shrink oversized pages to
paper size"</i>, and <i>"Expand small pages to paper size"</i> options are not checked in the print dialogue
box. Otherwise items on the page may be printed with the wrong dimensions.

</p>
In order to create an Album using the provided sample file please follow these simple steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Press the <i><b>Open</b></i> button to display the <i>File Open</i> dialogue box.
    Use this to navigate to the <i>examples</i> folder which should have
    been created when AlbumEasy was installed and then open the <i>AlbumSample.txt</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the <i>AlbumSample.txt</i> file has been loaded press the <i><b>Generate</b></i> button
    to create an album called AlbumSample.pdf that may now be viewed via Adobe Acrobat or a
    similar PDF viewer.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<td><h2>CREATING A CUSTOM ALBUM</h2></td>
</tr></table>
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
  The easiest way of creating a new album is to copy and modify an existing text file such as the
  provided example: AlbumSample.txt.   After copying the new file it should be given an
  appropriate name e.g. Canada.txt.
  </li>
  <li>
  The new text file is edited with a text editor using any of the commands
  listed in the <a href="commands.html">Commands</a> section of this help file to specify the album.
  </li>
  <li>
  After the file is saved it is opened with AlbumEasy which then generates the new album as a
  PDF file.
  </li>
</ol>

<td><h2>ADVANCED - USING FONTS</h2></td>
</tr></table>
</p>
AlbumEasy provides a number of built-in <a href="fonts.html">fonts</a> which are used for creating
text. These built-in fonts contain the characters in the
<a href="codepages.html#latin1">Latin 1</a> character set which should be sufficient for
displaying text in most Western European languages.

In addition to the built in fonts AlbumEasy is also able to display text using many of the fonts
installed on a user's system. This may be purely for aesthetic purposes or when necessary to display
international languages.<br />

The <i>examples</i> folder contains additional sample files illustrating this usage:
<ul>
<li>Font.txt: Illustrates how to load and use additional fonts.</li>
<li>International.txt: This illustrates how to load and use additional fonts to display
    international character sets. <b>Note:</b> This file has been saved in
    <a href="codepages.html#unicode">Unicode (UTF-8)</a> format. In order to generate albums
    correctly, it is necessary for AlbumEasy to be configured for <i>Unicode (UTF-8)</i> via
    the <a href="config.html#configDialogue">configuration dialogue box</a>.</li>
</ul>
