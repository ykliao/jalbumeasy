</a><h1>Character Sets</h1>
<p>
 AlbumEasy is able to processes text files encoded with either the <i>Unicode</i> or <i>Latin 1</i> character sets.
 The actual character set in use is specified in the <a href="config.html#configDialogue">configuration dialogue box</a>.
</p>

<a name="unicode"></a><h2>Unicode (UTF-8)</h2>
<p>
<i>Unicode</i> containing over 110,000 characters is able to encode almost every writing system in use worldwide.
AlbumEasy supports <i>UTF-8</i>, one of the more popular <i>Unicode</i> encoding standards.
</p>

<a name="latin1"></a><h2>Latin 1 (Windows CP1252)</h2>
<p>
The <i>Latin 1</i> character set, also known as <i>ISO-8859-1</i> consists of 191 "Latin Script"
characters. It is the default character set for Western Europe, the Americas, Oceania, and most of Africa.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately  <i>ISO-8859-1</i> omits a few characters that may be of use to philatelists, the most notable of which is the Euro symbol.
So instead AlbumEasy uses <i>Windows CP1252</i> which is a superset of <i>ISO-8859-1</i>.
<br />
<br />
It should therefore be noted that the use of <b><i>Latin 1</i></b> in relation to AlbumEasy is
not strictly correct as it actually refers to the <b><i>Windows CP1252</i></b> encoding instead
of <b><i>ISO-8859-1</i></b>.

<br />
<br />
The table below illustrates the characters provided by <i>ISO-88591-1</i> and <i>Windows CP1252</i>.
<br />Characters common to both are shown in black, the additional <i>Windows CP1252</i> characters are shown in red.
