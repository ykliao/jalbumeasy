Installing AlbumEasy on Linux
================================================================================

Move this folder to an appropriate location in the Linux file system e.g
/home/USER-NAME/AlbumEasy

Change to this folder and then execute the CONFIG script
./CONFIG
This will create a desktop shortcut for AlbumEasy as well as an  AlbumEasy documents folder
pre-populated with the examples.

AlbumEasy is dependant on the Qt 5 libraries, so it will not run if these are not installed.
The method used for installing  these libraries will depend on the particular Linux variant.

For example to install on Ubuntu V13.04 or newer issue the command:
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
